#  Unity Basic Shader_Graphs

Welcome to the **Unity Shader Graph Showcase** project!  
This project demonstrates a collection of custom shaders created using Unity's Shader Graph system. It's intended for learning, experimentation, and as a reference for creating real-time visual effects in Unity (URP).

---

##  Project Features

This repository includes the following Shader Graph effects:

-  **Dither Transparency Shader**  
  Applies a dither pattern for semi-transparent pixelation, useful for stylized fading and LOD effects.

-  **Alpha Clipping Shader**  
  Removes parts of the object based on alpha threshold. Ideal for leaves, fences, or any object with cutout textures.

-  **Transparency Shader**  
  Supports smooth blending and real-time transparency with adjustable opacity.

-  **Texture Scroll Shader**  
  Animates textures in UV space to simulate movement like flowing water, fire, or holograms.

-  **Fresnel Effect Shader**  
  Adds a rim-lighting or glow around objects based on viewing angle. Great for sci-fi or magical effects.

-  **Silhouette Shader**  
  Creates a black outline or solid silhouette of objects, often used for hidden-object highlighting or stealth gameplay.

-  **Wave Deformation Shader**  
  Uses sine wave calculations to create animated ripple or wave effects on mesh surfaces.

##  Requirements

- Unity **2022.3 LTS** or later  
- **URP (Universal Render Pipeline)** enabled  
- Shader Graph package installed (via Package Manager)

---

##  Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Unity-ShaderGraph-Showcase.git

2. **Open the project in Unity**  
   Launch Unity and open the project containing the shaders.

3. **Set up URP (Universal Render Pipeline)**  
   - Go to: `Assets > Settings > Graphics`  
   - Assign the **URP Asset** to ensure proper rendering

4. **Explore Shader Effects**  
   Navigate through each shader in the `Shaders/` folder to see those in action:
   - Dithering  
   - Alpha Clipping  
   - Transparency  
   - Texture Scrolling  
   - Fresnel Effect  
   - Silhouette  
   - Wave Distortion
